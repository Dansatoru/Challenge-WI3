# UiPath Automation Projects - UiPath Challenge

Welcome! 👋  
This repository showcases my automation work completed during the **FILS x UiPath Summer School 2025** — a collaboration between the **Faculty of Engineering in Foreign Languages (FILS)** at **UNST Politehnica Bucharest** and **UiPath**.

---

## 🧩 About the Program
As a FILS student, I participated in a summer training program focused on **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** using UiPath tools.  
We were challenged to create two automation projects:
1. A **UiPath Challenge** provided by UiPath engineers. ✅
2. A **Personal Project**, where I explored automation ideas freely.

Both projects were developed entirely in **UiPath Studio**, following real-world automation logic and RPA best practices.
